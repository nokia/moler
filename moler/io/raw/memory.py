External-IO connections based on memory buffer.

The only 3 requirements for these connections are:
(1) store Moler's connection inside self.moler_connection attribute
(2) plugin into Moler's connection the way IO outputs data to external world:
    self.moler_connection.how2send = self.send
(3) forward IO received data into self.moler_connection.data_received(data)
