"""
threaded.network_down_detector.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A fully-functional connection-observer using socket & threading.
Works on Python 2.7 as well as on 3.6

This example demonstrates basic concept of connection observer - entity
that is fully responsible for:
- observing data coming from connection till it catches what it is waiting for
- parsing that data to have "caught event" stored in expected form
- storing that result internally for later retrieval

Please note that this example is LAYER-1 usage which means:
- observer can't run by its own, must be fed with data (passive observer)
- observer can't be awaited, must be queried for status before asking for data
Another words - low level manual combining of all the pieces.
